            <h2>Concept</h2>
            <p>
                Project Two represents a deeper exploration of minimalist principles. Rather than simply reducing visual elements, this project uses constraint as a creative tool. By limiting the color palette, typeface options, and layout variations, we forced ourselves to achieve sophistication through subtlety.
            </p>
            <p>
                The project demonstrates that minimalism is not about having little content, but rather about presenting content in the clearest, most elegant way possible. Whitespace becomes an active design element rather than empty space.

        <!-- Approach -->
        <div style="margin-bottom: var(--spacing-xl);">
            <h2>Our Approach</h2>
            <p>
                We began by defining a strict set of design constraints. A single typeface family, two weights. A two-color system: black on white. One spacing scale. These limitations became liberating, allowing us to focus entirely on the relationships between elements.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each design decision was justified by function. No element exists for decoration alone. The resulting interface is clean, fast, and immediately understandable. Users know what to do because the design clearly communicates purpose.
            </p>
            <p>
                This approach also has significant performance benefits. By eliminating unnecessary imagery and decorative elements, the site loads faster and performs better across all devices and network conditions.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- User Experience -->
        <div style="margin-bottom: var(--spacing-xl);">
            <h2>User Experience Focus</h2>
            <p>
                Minimalist design is inherently user-centered. By removing distractions, we ensure users can focus on the content that matters. The interface is transparent—users don't think about the design, they simply use it.
            </p>
            <p>
                We implemented subtle micro-interactions that provide feedback without feeling intrusive. The custom cursor system exemplifies this approach: a carefully crafted interaction that enhances usability without compromising the clean aesthetic.
            </p>
            <p>
                Accessibility is built in from the start. High contrast ratios, clear typography, and logical navigation structures ensure the experience works for everyone.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Philosophy -->
        <div style="margin-bottom: var(--spacing-xl);">
            <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
            <p>
                "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication." This project embodies this principle. In a world of visual noise and competing attention, minimalism stands out by doing less. Every element earns its place through necessity and purpose.
            </p>
            <p>
                This approach is sustainable. Minimal designs are easier to maintain, update, and scale. They age gracefully because they're not bound to transient design trends. The principles demonstrated here will remain relevant years from now.
            </p>
